TMS9929A RGB Converter
======================

This RGB converter is based on this great project:
[TMS9929A RGB and Component adapter - A high resolution Component, RGB or SCART adapter for MSX and Colecovision](https://hackaday.io/project/13056-tms9929a-rgb-and-component-adapter).

It converts signals from a TMS9929 with correct colors to RGB.
